Q: Write a PySpark code to read a JSON file named "students.json" containing student records with the following schema: "name" (string), "age" (integer), "grade" (string). Filter the DataFrame to include only students whose age is greater than 18.

A: 

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Mock Test").getOrCreate()
schema = "name STRING, age INT, grade STRING" 

df = spark.read.schema(schema).json("students.json")
new_df = df.filter(df.age>18)

df.printSchema()
df.show()
